# SD network tools
Scripts needed for segmental duplications (SDs) analysis as a complex network;

Scripts for the SD network construction and analysis are in the **SD_network_analysis** folder. The **Grow_network_simulations** folder includes scripts needed for simulations of network growth according to UCM or PCM models.

To reproduce results from [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-021-07789-7) one can run the following jupyter notebooks ***net_simul_4git.ipynb*** and ***main_SDs_4git.ipynb***.

All notebooks needed to reproduce results from another publication [link](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.03.18.533287) are in the following folders: ***SD_jump_models*** and ***Analyze_SD_breakpoints***. One can build the SD network, predict the number of jumps in each locus and compare those predictions with alternative models. Also run ***SDs_repeats_flanks_4git.ipynb*** notebook to study genomic features of SD breakpoints.
