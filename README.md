# The SD network
Scripts needed for segmental duplications (SDs) analysis as a complex network;

Scripts for the SD network construction and analysis are in the **SD_network_analysis** folder. The **Network_simulations** folder includes scripts needed for simulations of network growth according to UCM or PCM models.
To reproduce results from [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-021-07789-7) one can run the following jupyter notebooks ***net_simul_4git.ipynb*** and ***main_SDs_4git.ipynb***.
