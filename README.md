# SD network tools

All scripts and notebooks needed to analyze segmental duplications (SDs) from a complex networks point of view are here. 

Ipython notebooks needed to reproduce results from [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-021-07789-7) are in **SD_network_analysis** and **Grow_network_simulations** folders. 

**Grow_network_simulations**: The SD network construction, parameters fitting, analysis of overalps between SDs and CNVs and analysis of the SD network characteristics (***main_SDs_4git.ipynb***).
**Grow_network_simulations**: Simulations of network growth copying models that include UCM and PCM models and parameters fitting (***net_simul_4git.ipynb***).


All notebooks needed to reproduce results from another publication [link](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.03.18.533287) are in the following folders: ***SD_jump_models*** and ***Analyze_SD_breakpoints***.



One can build the SD network, predict the number of jumps in each locus and compare those predictions with alternative models. Also run ***SDs_repeats_flanks_4git.ipynb*** notebook to study genomic features of SD breakpoints.
